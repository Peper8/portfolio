          <small>July 2018</small>
          <p>
            I landed my first job at SunlifeGrepa PH as a freelance insurance agent. During my time there, 
            I learned how to manage finances and make smart decisions about taking risks.

            <br>
            As a freelance insurance agent, I was responsible for selling insurance policies and helping clients choose the right coverage for 
            their needs.

          <small>September 2018 - April 2019</small>

            In the same year, I also had the opportunity to work as a freelance marketing consultant for a food-cart franchising company.
            <br>
            <br>
            My responsibilities included selling business concepts and assisting clients in choosing the right type of business for their budget. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As a consultant, I had to understand my clients' needs and present them with options that fit their goals and financial constraints, 
            while also explaining the potential risks and benefits of different business concepts.

          <small>March 2020</small>
          <p>
            My family and I decided to start our own milk tea business in March 2020, but unfortunately, we launched at the same time that the lockdown due to the COVID-19 virus began. 
            Despite this challenge, our venture gained traction, and we were able to open a second branch within a year. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, in January 2021, an enhanced community quarantine was implemented, and the increase in interest rates and increased in the competition made it difficult for
             our venture to maintain its profitability. As a result, we made a difficult decision to close our business in December 2022.

            I became a virtual assistant for an NFT whitelist service, where my responsibilities 
            included scheduling minting on a Google Sheet using pivot tables, creating fan art, and engaging with various communities 
            to build relationships on different projects.

            In this role, I gained valuable experience with tools like Google Sheets and pivot

            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, I learned how to become a graphic artist and animate images using Adobe After Effects, 
            which sparked my interest in web design, web development, and web3 development.

          <small>October 2022</small>

            To build websites from scratch, I have started learning WordPress, HTML5, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I am also using Adobe XD to 
            create layouts and prototypes of websites before beginning the web development process.
